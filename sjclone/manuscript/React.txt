-# Developing Kanban Application

React, even though a young library, has made a significant impact on the frontend development community. It introduced concepts such as virtual DOM and made the community understand the power of components. Its component oriented design approach works well for web and other domains. React isn't limited to the web after all. You can use it to develop mobile and terminal user interfaces even.

In this part we will implement a small Kanban application. During the process you will learn basics of React. As React is just a view library we will discuss supporting technology. Alt, a Flux framework, provides a good companion to React and allows you to keep your components clean. You will also see how to use React DnD to add drag and drop functionality to the board.
